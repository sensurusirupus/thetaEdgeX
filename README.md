<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

<img src="https://i.imghippo.com/files/vwFDw1720455924.png" alt="Logo" >

**ThetaEdgeX** is a comprehensive development tool designed to streamline the process of idea generation, coding, and deployment using the Theta Edge Cloud. By integrating AI-driven features and seamless theta edge cloud functionalities, ThetaEdgeX empowers developers to leverage the full potential of the Theta ecosystem.

### Key Features

1. **AI-Assisted Coding**:

   - **Chrome Extension**: Facilitates easy access to Theta Wallet, enabling users to create, import, and manage wallets, list NFTs, track account activity, and deploy contracts directly from the browser.
   - **Theta Edge Cloud**: Supports AI model deployment and inference, leveraging Theta's cloud capabilities for powerful computing tasks.

3. **AI TechStack Generator**:

   <img src="https://i.imghippo.com/files/t1LTd1720456092.png" alt="Logo" >

   - **Query-Based Tech Stack Generator**: An app that accepts input queries such as "How do I build an ERC-20 token on the Theta network?" and generates a tailored tech stack and step-by-step guide on building the desired application. This feature helps developers quickly get started on projects with the right tools and frameworks.

### Problem Solved

**Accessibility and Integration**:

- Current Theta Wallet and network functionalities are only accessible via the website, limiting their integration into various applications.
- ThetaEdgeX solves this by providing browser and VS Code extensions, making Theta’s capabilities easily accessible across different platforms and applications.

### Community and Ecosystem Growth

**Developer Empowerment**:

- **Theta Hackathon**: Supported by Theta Development Academy and ThetaCon, providing prizes and development advice to foster innovation.
- **Extensive Documentation**: Expands Theta's existing documentation, making it accessible to a broader audience and simplifying the development process.

### How ThetaEdgeX Expands the Theta Ecosystem

- **Enhanced Accessibility**: By integrating Theta functionalities into popular tools like VS Code and Chrome, developers can easily incorporate Theta into their workflows, promoting wider adoption.
- **Community Support**: Through hackathons and academy support, ThetaEdgeX fosters a strong and diverse developer community, essential for the long-term success of any technology.
- **Innovative Features**: AI-assisted coding, cloud functionalities, and the query-based tech stack generator not only streamline development but also demonstrate the advanced capabilities of the Theta network, attracting more developers and projects.

### Built With

This project utilizes a variety of major frameworks, languages, and technologies to provide a comprehensive and powerful development tool for the Theta network ecosystem. Below is a list of the key components used in building Theta EdgeX:

- **[Next.js](https://nextjs.org)**: A React framework for server-side rendering and generating static websites.
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org)**: A JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, used for server-side development.
- **[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org)**: A strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
- **[JavaScript](https://www.javascript.com)**: The core programming language used throughout the project for both frontend and backend development.
- **[Theta Edge Cloud](https://www.thetatoken.org)**: Utilized for deploying AI models and handling powerful computing tasks within the Theta network.
- **[Theta Tools](https://www.thetatoken.org/)**: A suite of tools provided by the Theta network to facilitate development and integration.
- **[Theta Video Services](https://www.thetatoken.org)**: Used for video uploading, streaming, and management functionalities.
- **Generative AI**: Leveraged for AI-assisted coding features, including code suggestions and natural language processing for documentation and queries.
- **Theta Model Deployments**: Implemented to support AI model deployment and inference, providing robust cloud capabilities.

These technologies and frameworks collectively ensure that ThetaEdgeX is a robust, scalable, and efficient tool for developers working within the Theta ecosystem.
